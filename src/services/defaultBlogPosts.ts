    excerpt: 'Everything London property owners need to know about identifying, preventing, and eliminating rat infestations. Learn about the latest control methods, legal requirements, and when to call professionals.',
    content: `Rat infestations in London have increased by 25% over the past five years, making effective control more important than ever. This comprehensive guide covers everything property owners need to know about dealing with these persistent pests.

## Understanding London's Rat Problem

London's extensive underground network, combined with aging Victorian sewers and abundant food sources, creates ideal conditions for rat populations. The common brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is particularly prevalent, capable of squeezing through gaps as small as 20mm.

### Signs of Rat Activity

Early detection is crucial for effective control. Look for these telltale signs:

- **Droppings**: Dark, pellet-shaped droppings 10-14mm long
- **Gnaw marks**: Fresh gnaw marks on wood, plastic, or cables
- **Tracks and runways**: Greasy marks along walls and well-worn paths
- **Sounds**: Scratching, squeaking, or scurrying in walls or ceilings
- **Nests**: Shredded materials in hidden areas
- **Smell**: Strong ammonia-like odor from urine

## Health Risks and Legal Obligations

Rats carry numerous diseases including Leptospirosis (Weil's disease), Salmonellosis, and Hantavirus. Under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949, property owners have a legal obligation to keep premises free from rats and mice.`,

    excerpt: 'As temperatures rise, wasp activity increases dramatically. Learn how to prevent nest formation and safely manage wasp problems on your property.',
    content: `Every summer, London properties face increased wasp activity that can pose serious risks to residents and visitors. This guide provides essential information for property managers and homeowners to prepare for and manage wasp season effectively.

## Understanding Wasp Behavior

### Seasonal Lifecycle
- **Spring (April-May)**: Queens emerge and begin nest building
- **Early Summer (June-July)**: Colony growth accelerates
- **Late Summer (August-September)**: Peak population and aggression
- **Autumn (October)**: Colony decline and dispersal

## Prevention is Key

Early spring prevention can prevent summer problems:

1. **Seal Entry Points**: Check and seal gaps in soffits, fascias, and roof tiles
2. **Remove Food Sources**: Cover bins, clean up spills, manage compost
3. **Regular Inspections**: Check sheds, lofts, and garages weekly
4. **Maintain Gardens**: Trim bushes, remove fallen fruit
5. **Install Screens**: Window and door screens prevent indoor entry`,
